 Double-click  `Docker.dmg`  to open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to the  **Applications**  folder. By default, Docker Desktop is installed at  `/Applications/Docker.app`.

The Docker menu displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.

**Here’s a summary of the key points:**

-   Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
-   Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
-   Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.
